### `Javascript or Typescript?`
We write our code entirely with typescript. All types of all of our methods, components and etc will be exported without the need to install a new package.

### `Dependencies`
You will need to install __styled components__ if you want to customize our components. Besides that, you don't have to install anything else.

To install __styled components__ run:
```
yarn add styled-components
```

And to help with **typescript**, install styled components types, by running:
```
yarn add -D @types/styled-components
```
