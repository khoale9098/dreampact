<AUTOGENERATED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS>

Framework to help creating a complete, reusable and responsive react application.

### `Atomic`
We build our components to be consistent and reusable, and for that, we choose to use Atomic Design to make them more efficient as possible.

### `Type today, type tommorow, type forever`
We write our code entirely with typescript and all types of all of our methods, components and etc will be exported without the need to install a new package.

### `Hooks`
We love React Hooks. To help build more complex or interactive or just fun applications, we wrote a few utility hooks to be used whatever you see that it fits.

A few examples are:

- [useInViewport](/dreampact/docs/hooks/use-in-viewport)
To check if a element is visible on screen.
- [useBrowserDetection](/dreampact/docs/hooks/use-browser-detection)
To get user browser name, version, operational system name, and etc.
- [useEventEmitter](/dreampact/docs/hooks/use-event-emitter)

And a lot more in our [documentation](/dreampact/docs/getting-started/introduction.html).
